# PIC-Library

A collection of position independent resources. Code snippets, blog posts, everything PIC.

During the development of [Hannibal](https://github.com/MythicAgents/Hannibal), I spent quite a bit of time looking for and adapting functionality. Many libraries were written in ways that were not easy to modify for position independent coding.

This repo is intended to create a central location to find content that is known PIC friendly. This will hopefully aid in the development process.



### Note

BOF related content has not been included as there are plenty of resources documenting BOF development. This repo is not dedicated to a specific format. It is designed to include functionality that is written in a PIC friendly way.

If you're looking for BOF resources, simply search Github: https://github.com/search?q=bof&type=repositories

Not all content has been tested. Snippets in general should be PIC friendly, but may require some modification to work with your codebase. Some linked projects are very old and no longer maintained. They may still be of use though.

## Navigation

> Snippets are organized in folders per language. Tables per type for external resources.
